##About
ProgramAttic is another passion-project/public repository for learning programming languages and encountering all sorts of programming problems. The inspiration behind this project comes from the fact that most of the time, school only covers theoretical stuff and applying those things are left out.

ProgramAttic is an ongoing project by Joe Ferrer, a computer science major in UPD, to mainly train /exercise / gain mastery in different programming languages as well as to create a compendium of programming problems for anyone who needs materials for training or teaching.

##Development
The scope of this project is to cover as many popular programming languages (C, Python, Ruby, Java, etc) and as many programming problems possible. Thus, the goal is to add atleast (1) programming problem per day, if possible, to every programming language it can be applied to. Updates are sure to come up so just watch out for them. Currently only the creator, Joe Ferrer, is the one contributing to this repository. Other contributors are most welcome.

__Note:__ The form of most programs here are stand alone programs, which just mean they only solve a specific problem. However, in case there is a need for an  Object-Oriented approach, especially in using programs as subprograms for larger programs which solve larger problems, adjustments (e.g. making standalones into classes if possible) maybe be made.

##Usage
This is a repository of all sorts of programming problems applied through all sorts of programming languages. Files are arranged according to programming languages. If you are looking for a particular problem, you can browse through each folder and scan for that problem. If you generally just want to expand your knowledge regarding programming languages feel free to wander in anyway you'd like in this repository. To run program files, you must have the appropriate compiler/interpreter for that program file, otherwise you will only be able to read it as plaintext.


__Warning:__ Using programs uploaded here directly as submissions for homework/tests/school requirements is highly discouraged (_if that is your purpose, you should be ashamed of yourself!_) The only way to become good in this discipline is to train hard. You're only cheating yourself if you try to copy other's work.
